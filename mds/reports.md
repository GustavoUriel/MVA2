SECTION: Description.
  I want a web application in flask that it's a pipeline for data processing. 
    It does a multivariate analysis on myeloma multiple patients using as covariates many fields of the patient and the taxonomy count of samples taken in different stages of the treatment. 


SECTION: Web interface.
  1. Welcome page and login
    It has to have a welcome page with description of the web app and login options.
    After login it has to show many controls and information. Some of them are: 
    1.a. A square with infomation of the sample: 
      count, media of duration variable, how many got to the event as percentage and as count, how many are undefined and how many havent arrived to the event, and you can add whatever other info you consider relevant.
    1.b. A button to ingest a new data set 
      with the option to ingest from excel file or from csv files (or pasting the csv file as text into a text field) and identify which tables is from the three tables that I will mention later on.
    1.c. A square that says load current data
      and has three button in it to load data from a excel file in /current , that has the three tables in its sheets. Needs to identify for each sheet which table is, or if none. And if is a table, load into the database. When pressing buton "load patients data" loads only the table patients, when pressing in load taxos loads only taxinomies table, and when pressing load brackens results loads only bracken table.
    1.d. A button to go to the data showing and preprocessing module/page.
      It shoul be grayed until the three databases are loaded, from the current folder or from the ingest data button.

  2. Data showing and preprocessing module.
    There it has many controls: 
    2.a. A square with infomation of the sample: 
      count, media of duration variable, how many got to the event as percentage and as count, how many are undefined and how many havent arrived to the event, and you can add whatever other info you consider relevant. Updated when the table below is modified.
    2.b. Next to that square it has to have a button to save the resulting view
      (and the generated results if it was already calculated) that includes the edited/filtered/sorted dataset from the table and all the parameters on all the controls(2.c, 2.d, 2.e, 2.f, 2.g) , for later use in the user's data library. And a combobox to load any saved view. And in that combo box, next to each view, a button to delete it (with confirmation).
    2.c. A set of on/off buttons to define if add sets of columns
      as antibiotics, antifungals, antivirals, demographics, disease_characteristics, FISH indicators, comorbidities, and other sets of data. That data groups are in a list in config.py under the comment // column_group, that is already provided in the project. But you can modify that if you think that is necessary. Just modify them to the config.py file.
    2.d. A set of option buttons to select wich set of bracken use
      (pre, during, pos, delta... or none). It is an option select that can select only one. Or none. If one is selected, a square with the title 'threshold', and a button that changes between count or proportion, and a slide to define the threshold to consider the taxo as a relevant variable. If the button is in proportion, the slider goes from 0 to 30%. If the button is in count, it goes logarithmically from 0 to 2/10 of the max value in bracken (that is, at first moves slow). 
    2.e. Two slider control To define the scope of the data analysis
      (on the duration variable) that goes from 10% to 50% and are linked, one for the top % of the sample and the other for the bottom % of the table, so it takes both edges for data analysis and don't mess with the middle data. It has a check box that says that the sliding controls are linked and move together, but if unchecked it can be moved separately.
    2.f. Data processing parameters: 
      a combo box to select the method (cox, rmst, and add any other that you consider that can be usefull). And controls to the parameters to the selected method (that change when changing the selected method.
    2.g. Clustering parameters
      like random seed for clustering, max num of clusters, and any other parameter that you consider it relevant. 
    2.h. A button to process the data
      with an estimate time to get the results that it calculates from previous processing, considering variations of the data size, the sets of columns to consider, and anything that you consider relevant to make that estimation accurate. And a smaller cancel button to cancel the data processing. That button goes to the results page after the calculation is finised. Until that it shows a clock cursor and locks all the controls. Only permits scrolling in the table and the cancel button. If the data has records with no consistence in the duration or the event fields, pop up an alert saying it and saying that you are going to fix that and explain how, and have a fix them button, a just discard the invalid data button, and a cancel button. Do as selected.
    2.i. And below that a golge sheet style table
      to see the whole patients table with the selected groups of data columns, and be able to remove rows, edit the data, remove cols, filter the data, rearrange the cols, and a function to find and replace in the data.
    The results page opens in a new tab when pressing the button in 2.h.

  3. Results page
    On the results page it shows:
    3.a. A square with infomation of the sample: 
      count, media of duration variable, how many got to the event as percentage and as count, how many are undefined and how many havent arrived to the event, and you can add whatever other info you consider relevant. Updated when the table below is modified.
    3.b. A summary of all the parameters from previous page
    3.c. A button to download 
      a well written with the style of a scientific paper, describing all that was done, since the data import and showing and explaining the results with graphs and tables that might apply.
    3.d. Clustering information. 
      3.d.1. A combobox to select the criteria to select the representative variable for the cluster
        (more variate, less variate, less amount of NA, and any other criteria that you can think of). Explain when selected a criteria to select the cluster representative, what are the reasons to choose any of them.
      3.d.2. A search box to search for any variable
        that opens the nested clusters and shows where it is clustered by highlighting it in yellow or green.
      3.d.3. A cluster map as a nested list
        it has the representative covariate and when clicking it opens the list of all the covariates that are clustered with it. Use the criteria selected in 3.d.1. to sort all the variables for each cluster when showing them.
      3.d.4. A button to download the cluster tree as a pdf file well explained
    3.e. Method parameters and filters
      The controls and results for the selected method. Now I'll enumerate if cox method was selected
      3.e.1 A sliding control to select the p value
        from more confidence to less confidence (I think that if p>0.5 the coefficient is not significant) It should be placed in a position relevant to the data, but can be moved by the user. It refreshes all the components below it, working only with the results that p is as the slider or less.
    3.f. A cox box graph of the top 20 relevant clusters
      (that is, that are absolutely more correlated to the duration variable)
    3.g. A cox analysis results table that shows the cox analysis result
      for all the covariates. It can be sorted by any column. Over it, a checkbox to mark if show only the top 20 clusters shown on the cox box graph, or all the clusters. 


SECTION: Internal working of the web app

  1- Regarding handling users: 
    It needs to have google authentication and user management
      with sessions isolation and multiple users simultaneity. The users have many fields for each of them, like text annotations, saved views (all its parameters as a json file), saved filtered or edited data sources (as a csv file), and saved results (as a comprehensive pdf report). Those saved are stored in storage folders and the user table has a list of dictionaries to them (type, name, file path, date of creation). A user can share any saved result to any other user that receives the save with the text (from xxx) added to the save name, where xxx is the name of the sender. If a result is not saved in any user, its file can be deleted. It would be nice to show the updated google profile photo next to the user on the top right. Also that clicking on the user it drops down a list with information and tools for the user, including managing the annotations, saves, etc. Be creative on that. 
  2- Regarding the source data: 
    source_a. Patients table. 
      I have a table of patients
        with a Patient_ID, a duration_variable, an event_indicator and many other fields.
      I will provide the name
        of the id field, the name of the duration variable and the name of the event variable in a config.py file under the comment // field_names Check it.
    source_b. Taxonomies table.
      I have a table of taxonomies clasifications
        (taxonomy_id ASV Taxonomy Domain Phylum Class Order Family Genus Species) that might be used to filtering.  
    source_c. Bracken table.
      I have a table with brackens results
        that has a column with the taxonomy_id, and 3 columns for each patient_id in patients, named with the text in patient_id plus an posfix: '.2.4M' means the sample they took from the patient 24 months after the start of treatment, '.P' means the results of the sample they took previous to the treatment and '.E' is a sample they took 2 months after the start of the treatment. And each cell has the results of the sample of that patient at that time for that taxonomy. That is the bracken table. I want to create auxiliary tables: 

  3- Regarding the working data: 
    With this we generate different tables each time the sources are modified:
    data_group_a. 
      A group of 6 tables that generated from bracken
        that has the column patient_id and one column for each taxonomy, that has the value of: for table bracken_pre teh value of the '.P' columns. for the table bracken_during the values of the '.E' columns, for te table bracken_pos the values of the '.2.4M' columns, for the table bracken_delta_01 the values of the column '.E' minus the column '.P', for the table bracken_delta_02 the values of the column '.2.4M' minus the column '.E', for the table bracken_delta_02 the values of the column '.2.4M' minus the column '.P'.
    data_group_b.
      A group of tables, one for each column groups in config.py as mentioned in 2.c.
        (as used in 2.c, with the name of the table as the name of the group.
    data_group_c. 
      The table of patients
        that is the original table of patients but removing all the columns that are in other column groups in config.py

  4- Regarding the data processing:
    Replace all the NA and invalid values in all fields but duration
    Try to get info for the duration event if NA or invalid,
      as mentioned in the pop up in the alert in 2.h.
    Merge the tables selected in the selector in 2.c.
      with the table patients, matching patient_id field.
    If a bracken is selected, merge it also with the selected one from 2.d. 
      Use the threshold value (percentual or count) in 2.d. If count, round to 0 the bracken values that are below the count threshold. If proportion, round to 0 the ones below the percentage of the max value for that column
    Select from that table only the patients
      that are in the edges of duration as selected by the slider for percentages in 2.e.
    Do clustering using the parameters in 2.g. to all the columns.
      The parameters to select the name of the cluster is: If there is a column from table patients, or demographics, or disease characteristics, or FISH indicators, or comorbidities, or taxos. Look for it in that order, the name of the cluster is that column. If there is more than one column from the group, select the one using the criteria in 3.d.1.
    Do the selected multivariate analysis method
    Present the results

  5- Regarding rules to apply in all the project.
    5.a. add comments to everything in the code
    5.b. add a logging agent and log everything in a log file
    5.c. all tables are user dependant, 
      that is that the user can load his own data and process it, while other user uses other set of data.
    5.d. Use the definitions in config.py under the comments // column_names_mapping
      to rename the columns names for the source patients table and the source taxonomy table. If it doesn't match use fuzzy method to asign each column.
    5.e. Use the definitions in config.py under the comments // identification_fields
    to recognize the columns names for the source patients table. If it doesn't match use fuzzy method to asign each column.
    5.f. For all the taxonomies handling we use the id.
      But in all the presentation on the page it needs to show the taxo name, not the id. 
      All taxos that are shown in the web app should show a popup with the taxo data when hovering on it 0.3 seconds)

  6- Regarding other auxiliary functions
    I will set in config.py 
      the expected column names for table patients and for table taxonomies. For table brackens it should have columns named as the patients id with the posfixes mentioned in 2.c. If the posfix don't match use fuzzy methods to identify them. The patient_id must match exactly.
    This project should be placed in a pythonanywhere account. Make it ready for that.
    This should be done using 
      flask, pandas, numpy, sklearn, lifelines, plotly, and any other library that you consider relevant. Use bootstrap or any other library to make the web app pretty and easy to use.
    All the code should be in a github repository
      that I can access. I will provide the repository link.
    All the controls and elements in the page
      should have a explanatory text next to it or in a popup after 1 second of hovering
    Add a page with a tutorial, 
      that is a extensive, detailed, precise explanation of everything that this webapp does in a technical but not so formal language. The target is scientifics that specializes on biomedicine and cancer treatment but don't know so much about mathmatics. Explain all the methods used to process the data, the algorithms used for clustering the methods for analysis and its differences, and how to interpret the results. It is a tutorial for the beginner to use this webapp.
    Remember that each user can have his own dataset. Each user has his own instance folder. Create a folder for each logged user that is named as as the user email (replace the @ with and underscore) inside the folder /instance
    Use that folder as user folder, for each user
    Use sqlalchemy for database
    Use logging for each user. The log file should be a file named as the user email before the @, and placed in the user folder
    Use python-dotenv to load environment variables from a .env file. I will place there the oauth credentials
    Check and add anything that might be missing in the .env file and in config.py

        SECTION: User Interface & Experience Design
          1. Welcome page and login
            It has to have a welcome page with description of the web app and login options.
            After login it has to show many controls and information. Some of them are: 
            1.a. A square with infomation of the sample: 
              count, media of duration variable, how many got to the event as percentage and as count, how many are undefined and how many havent arrived to the event, and you can add whatever other info you consider relevant.
            1.b. A button to ingest a new data set 
              with the option to ingest from excel file or from csv files (or pasting the csv file as text into a text field) and identify which tables is from the three tables that I will mention later on.
            1.c. A square that says load current data
              and has three button in it to load data from a excel file in /current , that has the three tables in its sheets. Needs to identify for each sheet which table is, or if none. And if is a table, load into the database. When pressing buton "load patients data" loads only the table patients, when pressing in load taxos loads only taxinomies table, and when pressing load brackens results loads only bracken table.
            1.d. A button to go to the data showing and preprocessing module/page.
              It shoul be grayed until the three databases are loaded, from the current folder or from the ingest data button.

          2. Data showing and preprocessing module.
            There it has many controls: 
            2.a. A square with infomation of the sample: 
              count, media of duration variable, how many got to the event as percentage and as count, how many are undefined and how many havent arrived to the event, and you can add whatever other info you consider relevant. Updated when the table below is modified.
            2.b. Next to that square it has to have a button to save the resulting view
              (and the generated results if it was already calculated) that includes the edited/filtered/sorted dataset from the table and all the parameters on all the controls(2.c, 2.d, 2.e, 2.f, 2.g) , for later use in the user's data library. And a combobox to load any saved view. And in that combo box, next to each view, a button to delete it (with confirmation).
            2.c. A set of on/off buttons to define if add sets of columns
              as antibiotics, antifungals, antivirals, demographics, disease_characteristics, FISH indicators, comorbidities, and other sets of data. That data groups are in a list in config.py under the comment // column_group, that is already provided in the project. But you can modify that if you think that is necessary. Just modify them to the config.py file.
            2.d. A set of option buttons to select wich set of bracken use
              (pre, during, pos, delta... or none). It is an option select that can select only one. Or none. If one is selected, a square with the title 'threshold', and a button that changes between count or proportion, and a slide to define the threshold to consider the taxo as a relevant variable. If the button is in proportion, the slider goes from 0 to 30%. If the button is in count, it goes logarithmically from 0 to 2/10 of the max value in bracken (that is, at first moves slow). 
            2.e. Two slider control To define the scope of the data analysis
              (on the duration variable) that goes from 10% to 50% and are linked, one for the top % of the sample and the other for the bottom % of the table, so it takes both edges for data analysis and don't mess with the middle data. It has a check box that says that the sliding controls are linked and move together, but if unchecked it can be moved separately.
            2.f. Data processing parameters: 
              a combo box to select the method (cox, rmst, and add any other that you consider that can be usefull). And controls to the parameters to the selected method (that change when changing the selected method.
            2.g. Clustering parameters
              like random seed for clustering, max num of clusters, and any other parameter that you consider it relevant. 
            2.h. A button to process the data
              with an estimate time to get the results that it calculates from previous processing, considering variations of the data size, the sets of columns to consider, and anything that you consider relevant to make that estimation accurate. And a smaller cancel button to cancel the data processing. That button goes to the results page after the calculation is finised. Until that it shows a clock cursor and locks all the controls. Only permits scrolling in the table and the cancel button. If the data has records with no consistence in the duration or the event fields, pop up an alert saying it and saying that you are going to fix that and explain how, and have a fix them button, a just discard the invalid data button, and a cancel button. Do as selected.
            2.i. And below that a golge sheet style table
              to see the whole patients table with the selected groups of data columns, and be able to remove rows, edit the data, remove cols, filter the data, rearrange the cols, and a function to find and replace in the data.
            The results page opens in a new tab when pressing the button in 2.h.

          3. Results page
            On the results page it shows:
            3.a. A square with infomation of the sample: 
              count, media of duration variable, how many got to the event as percentage and as count, how many are undefined and how many havent arrived to the event, and you can add whatever other info you consider relevant. Updated when the table below is modified.
            3.b. A summary of all the parameters from previous page
            3.c. A button to download 
              a well written with the style of a scientific paper, describing all that was done, since the data import and showing and explaining the results with graphs and tables that might apply.
            3.d. Clustering information. 
              3.d.1. A combobox to select the criteria to select the representative variable for the cluster
                (more variate, less variate, less amount of NA, and any other criteria that you can think of). Explain when selected a criteria to select the cluster representative, what are the reasons to choose any of them.
              3.d.2. A search box to search for any variable
                that opens the nested clusters and shows where it is clustered by highlighting it in yellow or green.
              3.d.3. A cluster map as a nested list
                it has the representative covariate and when clicking it opens the list of all the covariates that are clustered with it. Use the criteria selected in 3.d.1. to sort all the variables for each cluster when showing them.
              3.d.4. A button to download the cluster tree as a pdf file well explained
            3.e. Method parameters and filters
              The controls and results for the selected method. Now I'll enumerate if cox method was selected
              3.e.1 A sliding control to select the p value
                from more confidence to less confidence (I think that if p>0.5 the coefficient is not significant) It should be placed in a position relevant to the data, but can be moved by the user. It refreshes all the components below it, working only with the results that p is as the slider or less.
            3.f. A cox box graph of the top 20 relevant clusters
              (that is, that are absolutely more correlated to the duration variable)
            3.g. A cox analysis results table that shows the cox analysis result
              for all the covariates. It can be sorted by any column. Over it, a checkbox to mark if show only the top 20 clusters shown on the cox box graph, or all the clusters.

        SECTION: Internal working of the web app

          1- Regarding handling users: 
            It needs to have google authentication and user management
              with sessions isolation and multiple users simultaneity. The users have many fields for each of them, like text annotations, saved views (all its parameters as a json file), saved filtered or edited data sources (as a csv file), and saved results (as a comprehensive pdf report). Those saved are stored in storage folders and the user table has a list of dictionaries to them (type, name, file path, date of creation). A user can share any saved result to any other user that receives the save with the text (from xxx) added to the save name, where xxx is the name of the sender. If a result is not saved in any user, its file can be deleted. It would be nice to show the updated google profile photo next to the user on the top right. Also that clicking on the user it drops down a list with information and tools for the user, including managing the annotations, saves, etc. Be creative on that. 

          1.b. Enhanced User Management:
            - User roles and permissions (Admin, Researcher, Analyst, Viewer)
            - User activity tracking and audit logs
            - Customizable user preferences and settings
            - Multi-tenant data isolation with secure access controls
            - User onboarding and tutorial completion tracking
            - Notification system for shared content and system updates 
          2- Regarding the source data: 
            source_a. Patients table. 
              I have a table of patients
                with a Patient_ID, a duration_variable, an event_indicator and many other fields.
              I will provide the name
                of the id field, the name of the duration variable and the name of the event variable in a config.py file under the comment // field_names Check it.
            source_b. Taxonomies table.
              I have a table of taxonomies clasifications
                (taxonomy_id ASV Taxonomy Domain Phylum Class Order Family Genus Species) that might be used to filtering.  
            source_c. Bracken table.
              I have a table with brackens results
                that has a column with the taxonomy_id, and 3 columns for each patient_id in patients, named with the text in patient_id plus an posfix: '.2.4M' means the sample they took from the patient 24 months after the start of treatment, '.P' means the results of the sample they took previous to the treatment and '.E' is a sample they took 2 months after the start of the treatment. And each cell has the results of the sample of that patient at that time for that taxonomy. That is the bracken table. I want to create auxiliary tables: 

          3- Regarding the working data: 
            With this we generate different tables each time the sources are modified:
            data_group_a. 
              A group of 6 tables that generated from bracken
                that has the column patient_id and one column for each taxonomy, that has the value of: for table bracken_pre the value of the '.P' columns. for the table bracken_during the values of the '.E' columns, for the table bracken_pos the values of the '.2.4M' columns, for the table bracken_delta_01 the values of the column '.E' minus the column '.P', for the table bracken_delta_02 the values of the column '.2.4M' minus the column '.E', for the table bracken_delta_03 the values of the column '.2.4M' minus the column '.P'.
            data_group_b.
              A group of tables, one for each column groups in config.py as mentioned in 2.c.
                (as used in 2.c, with the name of the table as the name of the group.
            data_group_c. 
              The table of patients

          4- Regarding the data processing:
            Replace all the NA and invalid values in all fields but duration
            Try to get info for the duration event if NA or invalid,
              as mentioned in the pop up in the alert in 2.h.
            Merge the tables selected in the selector in 2.c.
              with the table patients, matching patient_id field.
            If a bracken is selected, merge it also with the selected one from 2.d. 
              Use the threshold value (percentual or count) in 2.d. If count, round to 0 the bracken values that are below the count threshold. If proportion, round to 0 the ones below the percentage of the max value for that column
            Select from that table only the patients
              that are in the edges of duration as selected by the slider for percentages in 2.e.
            Do clustering using the parameters in 2.g. to all the columns.
              The parameters to select the name of the cluster is: If there is a column from table patients, or demographics, or disease characteristics, or FISH indicators, or comorbidities, or taxos. Look for it in that order, the name of the cluster is that column. If there is more than one column from the group, select the one using the criteria in 3.d.1.
            Do the selected multivariate analysis method
            Present the results

          4.b. Advanced Data Processing Pipeline:
            - Automated data validation and quality assessment
            - Machine learning-based missing data imputation
            - Robust outlier detection using multiple algorithms
            - Feature engineering and selection automation
            - Cross-validation and model validation frameworks
            - Reproducible analysis with version tracking
            - Parallel processing for large datasets
            - Real-time progress monitoring and logging

          5- Regarding rules to apply in all the project.
            5.a. add comments to everything in the code
            5.b. add a logging agent and log everything in a log file
            5.c. all tables are user dependant, 
              that is that the user can load his own data and process it, while other user uses other set of data.
            5.d. Use the definitions in config.py under the comments // column_names_mapping
              to rename the columns names for the source patients table and the source taxonomy table. If it doesn't match use fuzzy method to asign each column.
            5.e. Use the definitions in config.py under the comments // identification_fields
            to recognize the columns names for the source patients table. If it doesn't match use fuzzy method to asign each column.
            5.f. For all the taxonomies handling we use the id.
              But in all the presentation on the page it needs to show the taxo name, not the id. 
              All taxos that are shown in the web app should show a popup with the taxo data when hovering on it 0.3 seconds)

          6- Regarding other auxiliary functions
            I will set in config.py 
              the expected column names for table patients and for table taxonomies. For table brackens it should have columns named as the patients id with the posfixes mentioned in 2.c. If the posfix don't match use fuzzy methods to identify them. The patient_id must match exactly.
            This project should be placed in a pythonanywhere account. Make it ready for that.
            This should be done using 
              flask, pandas, numpy, sklearn, lifelines, plotly, and any other library that you consider relevant. Use bootstrap or any other library to make the web app pretty and easy to use.
            All the code should be in a github repository
              that I can access. I will provide the repository link.
            All the controls and elements in the page
              should have a explanatory text next to it or in a popup after 1 second of hovering
            Add a page with a tutorial, 
              that is a extensive, detailed, precise explanation of everything that this webapp does in a technical but not so formal language. The target is scientifics that specializes on biomedicine and cancer treatment but don't know so much about mathmatics. Explain all the methods used to process the data, the algorithms used for clustering the methods for analysis and its differences, and how to interpret the results. It is a tutorial for the beginner to use this webapp.
            Remember that each user can have his own dataset. Each user has his own instance folder. Create a folder for each logged user that is named as as the user email (replace the @ with and underscore) inside the folder /instance
            Use that folder as user folder, for each user
            Use sqlalchemy for database
            Use logging for each user. The log file should be a file named as the user email before the @, and placed in the user folder
            Use python-dotenv to load environment variables from a .env file. I will place there the oauth credentials
            Check and add anything that might be missing in the .env file and in config.py

SECTION: User Interface & Experience Design
  1. Welcome page and login
    It has to have a welcome page with description of the web app and login options.
    After login it has to show many controls and information. Some of them are: 
    1.a. A square with infomation of the sample: 
      count, media of duration variable, how many got to the event as percentage and as count, how many are undefined and how many havent arrived to the event, and you can add whatever other info you consider relevant.
    1.b. A button to ingest a new data set 
      with the option to ingest from excel file or from csv files (or pasting the csv file as text into a text field) and identify which tables is from the three tables that I will mention later on.
    1.c. A square that says load current data
      and has three button in it to load data from a excel file in /current , that has the three tables in its sheets. Needs to identify for each sheet which table is, or if none. And if is a table, load into the database. When pressing buton "load patients data" loads only the table patients, when pressing in load taxos loads only taxinomies table, and when pressing load brackens results loads only bracken table.
    1.d. A button to go to the data showing and preprocessing module/page.
      It shoul be grayed until the three databases are loaded, from the current folder or from the ingest data button.

  2. Data showing and preprocessing module.
    There it has many controls: 
    2.a. A square with infomation of the sample: 
      count, media of duration variable, how many got to the event as percentage and as count, how many are undefined and how many havent arrived to the event, and you can add whatever other info you consider relevant. Updated when the table below is modified.
    2.b. Next to that square it has to have a button to save the resulting view
      (and the generated results if it was already calculated) that includes the edited/filtered/sorted dataset from the table and all the parameters on all the controls(2.c, 2.d, 2.e, 2.f, 2.g) , for later use in the user's data library. And a combobox to load any saved view. And in that combo box, next to each view, a button to delete it (with confirmation).
    2.c. A set of on/off buttons to define if add sets of columns
      as antibiotics, antifungals, antivirals, demographics, disease_characteristics, FISH indicators, comorbidities, and other sets of data. That data groups are in a list in config.py under the comment // column_group, that is already provided in the project. But you can modify that if you think that is necessary. Just modify them to the config.py file.
    2.d. A set of option buttons to select wich set of bracken use
      (pre, during, pos, delta... or none). It is an option select that can select only one. Or none. If one is selected, a square with the title 'threshold', and a button that changes between count or proportion, and a slide to define the threshold to consider the taxo as a relevant variable. If the button is in proportion, the slider goes from 0 to 30%. If the button is in count, it goes logarithmically from 0 to 2/10 of the max value in bracken (that is, at first moves slow). 
    2.e. Two slider control To define the scope of the data analysis
      (on the duration variable) that goes from 10% to 50% and are linked, one for the top % of the sample and the other for the bottom % of the table, so it takes both edges for data analysis and don't mess with the middle data. It has a check box that says that the sliding controls are linked and move together, but if unchecked it can be moved separately.
    2.f. Data processing parameters: 
      a combo box to select the method (cox, rmst, and add any other that you consider that can be usefull). And controls to the parameters to the selected method (that change when changing the selected method.
    2.g. Clustering parameters
      like random seed for clustering, max num of clusters, and any other parameter that you consider it relevant. 
    2.h. A button to process the data
      with an estimate time to get the results that it calculates from previous processing, considering variations of the data size, the sets of columns to consider, and anything that you consider relevant to make that estimation accurate. And a smaller cancel button to cancel the data processing. That button goes to the results page after the calculation is finised. Until that it shows a clock cursor and locks all the controls. Only permits scrolling in the table and the cancel button. If the data has records with no consistence in the duration or the event fields, pop up an alert saying it and saying that you are going to fix that and explain how, and have a fix them button, a just discard the invalid data button, and a cancel button. Do as selected.
    2.i. And below that a golge sheet style table
      to see the whole patients table with the selected groups of data columns, and be able to remove rows, edit the data, remove cols, filter the data, rearrange the cols, and a function to find and replace in the data.
    The results page opens in a new tab when pressing the button in 2.h.

  3. Results page
    On the results page it shows:
    3.a. A square with infomation of the sample: 
      count, media of duration variable, how many got to the event as percentage and as count, how many are undefined and how many havent arrived to the event, and you can add whatever other info you consider relevant. Updated when the table below is modified.
    3.b. A summary of all the parameters from previous page
    3.c. A button to download 
      a well written with the style of a scientific paper, describing all that was done, since the data import and showing and explaining the results with graphs and tables that might apply.
    3.d. Clustering information. 
      3.d.1. A combobox to select the criteria to select the representative variable for the cluster
        (more variate, less variate, less amount of NA, and any other criteria that you can think of). Explain when selected a criteria to select the cluster representative, what are the reasons to choose any of them.
      3.d.2. A search box to search for any variable
        that opens the nested clusters and shows where it is clustered by highlighting it in yellow or green.
      3.d.3. A cluster map as a nested list
        it has the representative covariate and when clicking it opens the list of all the covariates that are clustered with it. Use the criteria selected in 3.d.1. to sort all the variables for each cluster when showing them.
      3.d.4. A button to download the cluster tree as a pdf file well explained
    3.e. Method parameters and filters
      The controls and results for the selected method. Now I'll enumerate if cox method was selected
      3.e.1 A sliding control to select the p value
        from more confidence to less confidence (I think that if p>0.5 the coefficient is not significant) It should be placed in a position relevant to the data, but can be moved by the user. It refreshes all the components below it, working only with the results that p is as the slider or less.
    3.f. A cox box graph of the top 20 relevant clusters
      (that is, that are absolutely more correlated to the duration variable)
    3.g. A cox analysis results table that shows the cox analysis result
      for all the covariates. It can be sorted by any column. Over it, a checkbox to mark if show only the top 20 clusters shown on the cox box graph, or all the clusters.

SECTION: Internal working of the web app

  1- Regarding handling users: 
    It needs to have google authentication and user management
      with sessions isolation and multiple users simultaneity. The users have many fields for each of them, like text annotations, saved views (all its parameters as a json file), saved filtered or edited data sources (as a csv file), and saved results (as a comprehensive pdf report). Those saved are stored in storage folders and the user table has a list of dictionaries to them (type, name, file path, date of creation). A user can share any saved result to any other user that receives the save with the text (from xxx) added to the save name, where xxx is the name of the sender. If a result is not saved in any user, its file can be deleted. It would be nice to show the updated google profile photo next to the user on the top right. Also that clicking on the user it drops down a list with information and tools for the user, including managing the annotations, saves, etc. Be creative on that. 

  1.b. Enhanced User Management:
    - User roles and permissions (Admin, Researcher, Analyst, Viewer)
    - User activity tracking and audit logs
    - Customizable user preferences and settings
    - Multi-tenant data isolation with secure access controls
    - User onboarding and tutorial completion tracking
    - Notification system for shared content and system updates 
  2- Regarding the source data: 
    source_a. Patients table. 
      I have a table of patients
        with a Patient_ID, a duration_variable, an event_indicator and many other fields.
      I will provide the name
        of the id field, the name of the duration variable and the name of the event variable in a config.py file under the comment // field_names Check it.
    source_b. Taxonomies table.
      I have a table of taxonomies clasifications
        (taxonomy_id ASV Taxonomy Domain Phylum Class Order Family Genus Species) that might be used to filtering.  
    source_c. Bracken table.
      I have a table with brackens results
        that has a column with the taxonomy_id, and 3 columns for each patient_id in patients, named with the text in patient_id plus an posfix: '.2.4M' means the sample they took from the patient 24 months after the start of treatment, '.P' means the results of the sample they took previous to the treatment and '.E' is a sample they took 2 months after the start of the treatment. And each cell has the results of the sample of that patient at that time for that taxonomy. That is the bracken table. I want to create auxiliary tables: 

  3- Regarding the working data: 
    With this we generate different tables each time the sources are modified:
    data_group_a. 
      A group of 6 tables that generated from bracken
        that has the column patient_id and one column for each taxonomy, that has the value of: for table bracken_pre the value of the '.P' columns. for the table bracken_during the values of the '.E' columns, for the table bracken_pos the values of the '.2.4M' columns, for the table bracken_delta_01 the values of the column '.E' minus the column '.P', for the table bracken_delta_02 the values of the column '.2.4M' minus the column '.E', for the table bracken_delta_03 the values of the column '.2.4M' minus the column '.P'.
    data_group_b.
      A group of tables, one for each column groups in config.py as mentioned in 2.c.
        (as used in 2.c, with the name of the table as the name of the group.
    data_group_c. 
      The table of patients

  4- Regarding the data processing:
    Replace all the NA and invalid values in all fields but duration
    Try to get info for the duration event if NA or invalid,
      as mentioned in the pop up in the alert in 2.h.
    Merge the tables selected in the selector in 2.c.
      with the table patients, matching patient_id field.
    If a bracken is selected, merge it also with the selected one from 2.d. 
      Use the threshold value (percentual or count) in 2.d. If count, round to 0 the bracken values that are below the count threshold. If proportion, round to 0 the ones below the percentage of the max value for that column
    Select from that table only the patients
      that are in the edges of duration as selected by the slider for percentages in 2.e.
    Do clustering using the parameters in 2.g. to all the columns.
      The parameters to select the name of the cluster is: If there is a column from table patients, or demographics, or disease characteristics, or FISH indicators, or comorbidities, or taxos. Look for it in that order, the name of the cluster is that column. If there is more than one column from the group, select the one using the criteria in 3.d.1.
    Do the selected multivariate analysis method
    Present the results

  4.b. Advanced Data Processing Pipeline:
    - Automated data validation and quality assessment
    - Machine learning-based missing data imputation
    - Robust outlier detection using multiple algorithms
    - Feature engineering and selection automation
    - Cross-validation and model validation frameworks
    - Reproducible analysis with version tracking
    - Parallel processing for large datasets
    - Real-time progress monitoring and logging

  5- Regarding rules to apply in all the project.
    5.a. add comments to everything in the code
    5.b. add a logging agent and log everything in a log file
    5.c. all tables are user dependant, 
      that is that the user can load his own data and process it, while other user uses other set of data.
    5.d. Use the definitions in config.py under the comments // column_names_mapping
      to rename the columns names for the source patients table and the source taxonomy table. If it doesn't match use fuzzy method to asign each column.
    5.e. Use the definitions in config.py under the comments // identification_fields
    to recognize the columns names for the source patients table. If it doesn't match use fuzzy method to asign each column.
    5.f. For all the taxonomies handling we use the id.
      But in all the presentation on the page it needs to show the taxo name, not the id. 
      All taxos that are shown in the web app should show a popup with the taxo data when hovering on it 0.3 seconds)

  6- Regarding other auxiliary functions
    I will set in config.py 
      the expected column names for table patients and for table taxonomies. For table brackens it should have columns named as the patients id with the posfixes mentioned in 2.c. If the posfix don't match use fuzzy methods to identify them. The patient_id must match exactly.
    This project should be placed in a pythonanywhere account. Make it ready for that.
    This should be done using 
      flask, pandas, numpy, sklearn, lifelines, plotly, and any other library that you consider relevant. Use bootstrap or any other library to make the web app pretty and easy to use.
    All the code should be in a github repository
      that I can access. I will provide the repository link.
    All the controls and elements in the page
      should have a explanatory text next to it or in a popup after 1 second of hovering
    Add a page with a tutorial, 
      that is a extensive, detailed, precise explanation of everything that this webapp does in a technical but not so formal language. The target is scientifics that specializes on biomedicine and cancer treatment but don't know so much about mathmatics. Explain all the methods used to process the data, the algorithms used for clustering the methods for analysis and its differences, and how to interpret the results. It is a tutorial for the beginner to use this webapp.
    Remember that each user can have his own dataset. Each user has his own instance folder. Create a folder for each logged user that is named as as the user email (replace the @ with and underscore) inside the folder /instance
    Use that folder as user folder, for each user
    Use sqlalchemy for database
    Use logging for each user. The log file should be a file named as the user email before the @, and placed in the user folder
    Use python-dotenv to load environment variables from a .env file. I will place there the oauth credentials
    Check and add anything that might be missing in the .env file and in config.py

# Third prompt
## Prompt:
Now I want to add something to the future project so I need you to add this to the prompt file that I will use to build this project:
I want to add under the select buttons (that are multiple selectables) in as in 2.c. anoter selectable button (option, only one can be selected) that has many buttons/options: None, FISH indicators, disease characteristics, demographics, and genomic_markers. When selected None this webapp does the multivariate analysis in all the variables together, as it is planned up to now. But when selecting any other of this options buttons, the webapp use a hybrid strategy: model all the columns of that set of columns together into groups using different factors depending on the natural characteristics of that group (for instance, for FISH indicators it can group sensibly as: i.Biology-driven grouping: gains vs losses, per‑chromosome (chr1, chr3, etc.), known high‑risk sets (del17p, t(4;14), 1q+). ii.Data-driven grouping as supplement: cluster correlated FISH flags, PCA on FISH matrix, or create counts (number of abnormalities). iii.Treat very-rare flags as “other_rare_FISH” or pool them.) and does the multivariate analysis for each group, generating a tabbed results page for each group and another tab that compares them. If you think that it would be usefull to group by any other groups of columns, add that button also. The webapp preserves the ability to generate reports for the mva for each group, and also a complete report that includes the reports for all the groups and also the analysis and comparation of results of all the groups.
It needs to have a text next to the buttons that explain in medical and techical termns what are the advantages of the selected choice of grouping (or not grouping).
Mantain the specifications that I gave before for the reports, help pages, texts, etc in all the scope of the project.
After you do this, please generate a report explaining all the changes that you did.

SECTION: User Interface & Experience Design
  1. Welcome page and login
    It has to have a welcome page with description of the web app and login options.
    After login it has to show many controls and information. Some of them are: 
    1.a. A square with infomation of the sample: 
      count, media of duration variable, how many got to the event as percentage and as count, how many are undefined and how many havent arrived to the event, and you can add whatever other info you consider relevant.
    1.b. A button to ingest a new data set 
      with the option to ingest from excel file or from csv files (or pasting the csv file as text into a text field) and identify which tables is from the three tables that I will mention later on.
    1.c. A square that says load current data
      and has three button in it to load data from a excel file in /current , that has the three tables in its sheets. Needs to identify for each sheet which table is, or if none. And if is a table, load into the database. When pressing buton "load patients data" loads only the table patients, when pressing in load taxos loads only taxinomies table, and when pressing load brackens results loads only bracken table.
    1.d. A button to go to the data showing and preprocessing module/page.
      It shoul be grayed until the three databases are loaded, from the current folder or from the ingest data button.

  2. Data showing and preprocessing module.
    There it has many controls: 
    2.a. A square with infomation of the sample: 
      count, media of duration variable, how many got to the event as percentage and as count, how many are undefined and how many havent arrived to the event, and you can add whatever other info you consider relevant. Updated when the table below is modified.
    2.b. Next to that square it has to have a button to save the resulting view
      (and the generated results if it was already calculated) that includes the edited/filtered/sorted dataset from the table and all the parameters on all the controls(2.c, 2.d, 2.e, 2.f, 2.g) , for later use in the user's data library. And a combobox to load any saved view. And in that combo box, next to each view, a button to delete it (with confirmation).
    2.c. A set of on/off buttons to define if add sets of columns
      as antibiotics, antifungals, antivirals, demographics, disease_characteristics, FISH indicators, comorbidities, and other sets of data. That data groups are in a list in config.py under the comment // column_group, that is already provided in the project. But you can modify that if you think that is necessary. Just modify them to the config.py file.
    
    2.c.1. Advanced Grouping Strategy Selector
      Below the column set selectors (2.c), add a single-selection option group with the following choices:
      - None (default): Perform standard multivariate analysis on all selected variables together
      - FISH Indicators: Apply hybrid grouping strategy specifically for cytogenetic data
      - Disease Characteristics: Group clinical and laboratory parameters by biological pathways
      - Demographics: Group patient characteristics by risk stratification categories
      - Genomic Markers: Group molecular markers by functional pathways and mutation types
      - Laboratory Values: Group lab results by organ system and prognostic significance

      - Biology-driven groups: gains vs losses, per-chromosome (chr1, chr3, chr5, chr7, chr9, chr11, chr13, chr15, chr17, chr19, chr21), known high-risk sets (del17p, t(4;14), t(14;16), t(14;20), 1q+, del1p32), complex vs simple abnormalities
      - Data-driven supplemental groups: correlation-based clustering of FISH flags, PCA components on FISH matrix, count-based groups (number of abnormalities per patient)
      - Rare event pooling: flags with <5% prevalence grouped as "rare_FISH_abnormalities"
      - Clinical relevance groups: standard-risk, intermediate-risk, high-risk, ultra-high-risk based on IMWG criteria
      
      Disease Characteristics Grouping Strategy:
      - Immunoglobulin profile: IgG, IgA, biclonal patterns, light chain restriction

      Display contextual help text explaining the medical and technical advantages of each grouping strategy:
      
      "None" Selection Info:
      "Standard multivariate analysis treating all variables independently. Advantages: Preserves individual variable effects, maintains statistical power for common variables, suitable when sample size exceeds 10 events per variable. Disadvantages: May suffer from multiple testing burden, unstable estimates for rare events, difficulty interpreting complex interactions."
      
      "FISH Indicators" Selection Info:
      "Cytogenetic-focused analysis grouping chromosomal abnormalities by biological significance. Medical advantages: Reflects known pathogenic pathways, aligns with clinical risk stratification, improves power for rare abnormalities. Technical advantages: Reduces dimensionality while preserving biological relevance, stabilizes estimates through hierarchical modeling, enables pathway-level interpretation."

Technical advantages: Temporal correlation structure, improved power for treatment comparisons, enables personalized treatment algorithms."
    2.d. A set of option buttons to select wich set of bracken use
      (pre, during, pos, delta... or none). It is an option select that can select only one. Or none. If one is selected, a square with the title 'threshold', and a button that changes between count or proportion, and a slide to define the threshold to consider the taxo as a relevant variable. If the button is in proportion, the slider goes from 0 to 30%. If the button is in count, it goes logarithmically from 0 to 2/10 of the max value in bracken (that is, at first moves slow). 
    2.e. Two slider control To define the scope of the data analysis
      (on the duration variable) that goes from 10% to 50% and are linked, one for the top % of the sample and the other for the bottom % of the table, so it takes both edges for data analysis and don't mess with the middle data. It has a check box that says that the sliding controls are linked and move together, but if unchecked it can be moved separately.
    2.f. Data processing parameters: 
      a combo box to select the method (cox, rmst, and add any other that you consider that can be usefull). And controls to the parameters to the selected method (that change when changing the selected method.
    2.g. Clustering parameters
      like random seed for clustering, max num of clusters, and any other parameter that you consider it relevant. 
    2.h. A button to process the data
      with an estimate time to get the results that it calculates from previous processing, considering variations of the data size, the sets of columns to consider, and anything that you consider relevant to make that estimation accurate. And a smaller cancel button to cancel the data processing. That button goes to the results page after the calculation is finised. Until that it shows a clock cursor and locks all the controls. Only permits scrolling in the table and the cancel button. If the data has records with no consistence in the duration or the event fields, pop up an alert saying it and saying that you are going to fix that and explain how, and have a fix them button, a just discard the invalid data button, and a cancel button. Do as selected.
    2.i. And below that a golge sheet style table
      to see the whole patients table with the selected groups of data columns, and be able to remove rows, edit the data, remove cols, filter the data, rearrange the cols, and a function to find and replace in the data.
    The results page opens in a new tab when pressing the button in 2.h.

  3. Results page
    On the results page it shows:
    3.a. A square with infomation of the sample: 
      count, media of duration variable, how many got to the event as percentage and as count, how many are undefined and how many havent arrived to the event, and you can add whatever other info you consider relevant. Updated when the table below is modified.
    3.b. A summary of all the parameters from previous page
    3.c. Advanced Results Display for Grouping Strategies
      When a grouping strategy other than "None" is selected, the results page displays:

      The controls and results for the selected method. Now I'll enumerate if cox method was selected
      3.e.1 A sliding control to select the p value
        from more confidence to less confidence (I think that if p>0.5 the coefficient is not significant) It should be placed in a position relevant to the data, but can be moved by the user. It refreshes all the components below it, working only with the results that p is as the slider or less.
    3.f. A cox box graph of the top 20 relevant clusters
      (that is, that are absolutely more correlated to the duration variable)
    3.g. A cox analysis results table that shows the cox analysis result
      for all the covariates. It can be sorted by any column. Over it, a checkbox to mark if show only the top 20 clusters shown on the cox box graph, or all the clusters.

SECTION: Internal working of the web app

  1- Regarding handling users: 
    It needs to have google authentication and user management
      with sessions isolation and multiple users simultaneity. The users have many fields for each of them, like text annotations, saved views (all its parameters as a json file), saved filtered or edited data sources (as a csv file), and saved results (as a comprehensive pdf report). Those saved are stored in storage folders and the user table has a list of dictionaries to them (type, name, file path, date of creation). A user can share any saved result to any other user that receives the save with the text (from xxx) added to the save name, where xxx is the name of the sender. If a result is not saved in any user, its file can be deleted. It would be nice to show the updated google profile photo next to the user on the top right. Also that clicking on the user it drops down a list with information and tools for the user, including managing the annotations, saves, etc. Be creative on that. 

  1.b. Enhanced User Management:
    - User roles and permissions (Admin, Researcher, Analyst, Viewer)
    - User activity tracking and audit logs
    - Customizable user preferences and settings
    - Multi-tenant data isolation with secure access controls
    - User onboarding and tutorial completion tracking
    - Notification system for shared content and system updates 
  2- Regarding the source data: 
    source_a. Patients table. 
      I have a table of patients
        with a Patient_ID, a duration_variable, an event_indicator and many other fields.
      I will provide the name
        of the id field, the name of the duration variable and the name of the event variable in a config.py file under the comment // field_names Check it.
    source_b. Taxonomies table.
      I have a table of taxonomies clasifications
        (taxonomy_id ASV Taxonomy Domain Phylum Class Order Family Genus Species) that might be used to filtering.  
    source_c. Bracken table.
      I have a table with brackens results
        that has a column with the taxonomy_id, and 3 columns for each patient_id in patients, named with the text in patient_id plus an posfix: '.2.4M' means the sample they took from the patient 24 months after the start of treatment, '.P' means the results of the sample they took previous to the treatment and '.E' is a sample they took 2 months after the start of the treatment. And each cell has the results of the sample of that patient at that time for that taxonomy. That is the bracken table. I want to create auxiliary tables: 

  3- Regarding the working data: 
    With this we generate different tables each time the sources are modified:
    data_group_a. 
      A group of 6 tables that generated from bracken
        that has the column patient_id and one column for each taxonomy, that has the value of: for table bracken_pre the value of the '.P' columns. for the table bracken_during the values of the '.E' columns, for the table bracken_pos the values of the '.2.4M' columns, for the table bracken_delta_01 the values of the column '.E' minus the column '.P', for the table bracken_delta_02 the values of the column '.2.4M' minus the column '.E', for the table bracken_delta_03 the values of the column '.2.4M' minus the column '.P'.
    data_group_b.
      A group of tables, one for each column groups in config.py as mentioned in 2.c.
        (as used in 2.c, with the name of the table as the name of the group.
    data_group_c. 
      The table of patients

  4- Regarding the data processing:
    Standard Processing (when "None" grouping is selected):
    Replace all the NA and invalid values in all fields but duration
    Try to get info for the duration event if NA or invalid,
      as mentioned in the pop up in the alert in 2.h.
    Merge the tables selected in the selector in 2.c.
      with the table patients, matching patient_id field.
    If a bracken is selected, merge it also with the selected one from 2.d. 
      Use the threshold value (percentual or count) in 2.d. If count, round to 0 the bracken values that are below the count threshold. If proportion, round to 0 the ones below the percentage of the max value for that column
    Select from that table only the patients
      that are in the edges of duration as selected by the slider for percentages in 2.e.
    Do clustering using the parameters in 2.g. to all the columns.
      The parameters to select the name of the cluster is: If there is a column from table patients, or demographics, or disease characteristics, or FISH indicators, or comorbidities, or taxos. Look for it in that order, the name of the cluster is that column. If there is more than one column from the group, select the one using the criteria in 3.d.1.
    Do the selected multivariate analysis method
    Present the results
    
    Advanced Grouping Processing (when specific grouping strategy is selected):
    Follow the same initial data cleaning and merging steps as standard processing, then:
    
    4.1. Group Definition and Validation:
      - Apply the selected grouping strategy from GROUPING_STRATEGIES configuration
      - Validate group composition and check for overlapping variables
      - Calculate group-specific prevalence and missing data patterns
      - Identify rare events within groups and apply pooling strategies
      - Create group-level summary variables and counts
    
    4.2. Within-Group Analysis:
      - Perform univariate analysis for each variable within its group
      - Calculate group-specific correlation matrices and clustering
      - Apply group-appropriate missing data imputation strategies
      - Conduct group-level feature selection and dimensionality reduction
      - Generate group-specific risk scores and composite variables
    
    4.3. Group-Level Modeling:
      - Fit separate multivariate models for each group using group-appropriate methods
      - Apply hierarchical modeling when groups have natural nested structure
      - Use pathway-based constraints for biologically-defined groups
      - Implement stratified analysis for demographic and clinical groups
      - Perform temporal analysis for treatment-related groups
    
    4.4. Cross-Group Analysis:
      - Compare effect sizes and statistical significance across groups
      - Test for group-level interactions and effect modification
      - Perform meta-analysis across groups when appropriate
      - Calculate group-specific model performance metrics (C-index, AIC, BIC)
      - Assess clinical relevance and importance ranking of groups
    
    4.5. Integrated Results Generation:
      - Combine group-specific results into unified risk prediction models
      - Generate hierarchical risk stratification incorporating all groups
      - Create clinical decision algorithms based on group findings
      - Develop personalized risk scores using group-specific weights
      - Produce comprehensive interpretation with clinical recommendations

  4.b. Advanced Data Processing Pipeline:
    - Automated data validation and quality assessment
    - Machine learning-based missing data imputation
    - Robust outlier detection using multiple algorithms
    - Feature engineering and selection automation
    - Cross-validation and model validation frameworks
    - Reproducible analysis with version tracking
    - Parallel processing for large datasets
    - Real-time progress monitoring and logging

  5- Regarding rules to apply in all the project.
    5.a. add comments to everything in the code
    5.b. add a logging agent and log everything in a log file
    5.c. all tables are user dependant, 
      that is that the user can load his own data and process it, while other user uses other set of data.
    5.d. Use the definitions in config.py under the comments // column_names_mapping
      to rename the columns names for the source patients table and the source taxonomy table. If it doesn't match use fuzzy method to asign each column.
    5.e. Use the definitions in config.py under the comments // identification_fields
    to recognize the columns names for the source patients table. If it doesn't match use fuzzy method to asign each column.
    5.f. For all the taxonomies handling we use the id.
      But in all the presentation on the page it needs to show the taxo name, not the id. 
      All taxos that are shown in the web app should show a popup with the taxo data when hovering on it 0.3 seconds)

  6- Regarding other auxiliary functions
    I will set in config.py 
      the expected column names for table patients and for table taxonomies. For table brackens it should have columns named as the patients id with the posfixes mentioned in 2.c. If the posfix don't match use fuzzy methods to identify them. The patient_id must match exactly.
    This project should be placed in a pythonanywhere account. Make it ready for that.
    This should be done using 
      flask, pandas, numpy, sklearn, lifelines, plotly, and any other library that you consider relevant. Use bootstrap or any other library to make the web app pretty and easy to use.
    All the code should be in a github repository
      that I can access. I will provide the repository link.
    All the controls and elements in the page
      should have a explanatory text next to it or in a popup after 1 second of hovering
    Add a page with a tutorial, 
      that is a extensive, detailed, precise explanation of everything that this webapp does in a technical but not so formal language. The target is scientifics that specializes on biomedicine and cancer treatment but don't know so much about mathmatics. Explain all the methods used to process the data, the algorithms used for clustering the methods for analysis and its differences, and how to interpret the results. It is a tutorial for the beginner to use this webapp.

SECTION: Internal working of the web app

  1- Regarding handling users: 
    It needs to have google authentication and user management
      with sessions isolation and multiple users simultaneity. The users have many fields for each of them, like text annotations, saved views (all its parameters as a json file), saved filtered or edited data sources (as a csv file), and saved results (as a comprehensive pdf report). Those saved are stored in storage folders and the user table has a list of dictionaries to them (type, name, file path, date of creation). A user can share any saved result to any other user that receives the save with the text (from xxx) added to the save name, where xxx is the name of the sender. If a result is not saved in any user, its file can be deleted. It would be nice to show the updated google profile photo next to the user on the top right. Also that clicking on the user it drops down a list with information and tools for the user, including managing the annotations, saves, etc. Be creative on that.

      I have a table with brackens results
        that has a column with the taxonomy_id, and 3 columns for each patient_id in patients, named with the text in patient_id plus an posfix: '.2.4M' means the sample they took from the patient 24 months after the start of treatment, '.P' means the results of the sample they took previous to the treatment and '.E' is a sample they took 2 months after the start of the treatment. And each cell has the results of the sample of that patient at that time for that taxonomy. That is the bracken table. I want to create auxiliary tables: 

  3- Regarding the working data: 
    With this we generate different tables each time the sources are modified:
    data_group_a. 
      A group of 6 tables that generated from bracken
        that has the column patient_id and one column for each taxonomy, that has the value of: for table bracken_pre the value of the '.P' columns. for the table bracken_during the values of the '.E' columns, for the table bracken_pos the values of the '.2.4M' columns, for the table bracken_delta_01 the values of the column '.E' minus the column '.P', for the table bracken_delta_02 the values of the column '.2.4M' minus the column '.E', for the table bracken_delta_03 the values of the column '.2.4M' minus the column '.P'.
    data_group_b.
      A group of tables, one for each column groups in config.py as mentioned in 2.c.
        (as used in 2.c, with the name of the table as the name of the group.

    - Decision curve analysis for clinical utility assessment

    Standard Processing (when "None" grouping is selected):
    Replace all the NA and invalid values in all fields but duration
    Try to get info for the duration event if NA or invalid,
      as mentioned in the pop up in the alert in 2.h.
    Merge the tables selected in the selector in 2.c.
      with the table patients, matching patient_id field.
    If a bracken is selected, merge it also with the selected one from 2.d. 
      Use the threshold value (percentual or count) in 2.d. If count, round to 0 the bracken values that are below the count threshold. If proportion, round to 0 the ones below the percentage of the max value for that column
    Select from that table only the patients
      that are in the edges of duration as selected by the slider for percentages in 2.e.
    Do clustering using the parameters in 2.g. to all the columns.
      The parameters to select the name of the cluster is: If there is a column from table patients, or demographics, or disease characteristics, or FISH indicators, or comorbidities, or taxos. Look for it in that order, the name of the cluster is that column. If there is more than one column from the group, select the one using the criteria in 3.d.1.

      to rename the columns names for the source patients table and the source taxonomy table. If it doesn't match use fuzzy method to asign each column.
    5.e. Use the definitions in config.py under the comments // identification_fields
    to recognize the columns names for the source patients table. If it doesn't match use fuzzy method to asign each column.
    5.f. For all the taxonomies handling we use the id.
      But in all the presentation on the page it needs to show the taxo name, not the id. 
      All taxos that are shown in the web app should show a popup with the taxo data when hovering on it 0.3 seconds)

  6- Regarding other auxiliary functions
    I will set in config.py 
      the expected column names for table patients and for table taxonomies. For table brackens it should have columns named as the patients id with the posfixes mentioned in 2.c. If the posfix don't match use fuzzy methods to identify them. The patient_id must match exactly.
    This project should be placed in a pythonanywhere account. Make it ready for that.
    This should be done using 
      flask, pandas, numpy, sklearn, lifelines, plotly, and any other library that you consider relevant. Use bootstrap or any other library to make the web app pretty and easy to use.
    All the code should be in a github repository
      that I can access. I will provide the repository link.
    All the controls and elements in the page
      should have a explanatory text next to it or in a popup after 1 second of hovering
    Add a page with a tutorial, 
      that is a extensive, detailed, precise explanation of everything that this webapp does in a technical but not so formal language. The target is scientifics that specializes on biomedicine and cancer treatment but don't know so much about mathmatics. Explain all the methods used to process the data, the algorithms used for clustering the methods for analysis and its differences, and how to interpret the results. It is a tutorial for the beginner to use this webapp.

    Remember that each user can have his own dataset. Each user has his own instance folder. Create a folder for each logged user that is named as as the user email (replace the @ with and underscore) inside the folder /instance
    Use that folder as user folder, for each user
    Use sqlalchemy for database
    Use logging for each user. The log file should be a file named as the user email before the @, and placed in the user folder
